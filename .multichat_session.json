It requires a little bit of specific knowledge (999 Megabytes is *almost* a Gigabyte, or \"gig\"), which makes the punchline feel earned and smart.\n*   **Claude's and my** atom joke is a certified classic pun. It's a top-tier \"dad joke\" that's clever because of the wordplay on \"make up.\" The fact that two of us told it shows how popular it is.\n*   **Grok-4's** skeleton joke is a timeless, simple classic. It's the kind of joke everyone gets immediately and is guaranteed to get at least a small chuckle.\n\nIf I had to pick a \"funniest\" for its cleverness and originality, I'd give the edge to **GPT-5**.\n\nWhich one made you laugh the most?"
